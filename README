=== OVERVIEW ===
gbla is a library for reducing matrices coming from Groebner basis computations.
Its core functionality is the special Gaussian Elimination of
structured hybrid sparse-dense matrices due to Faug√®re and Lachartre.



=== DEBUGGING ===
In order to debug gb one needs to use
libtool e gdb --args ./gbla --options
since we build the library using libtool and link it than against the binary gb.
