=== OVERVIEW ===
gb is a library for computing Groebner bases. Its core functionality at the
moment is the special Gaussian Elimination of structured hybrid sparse-dense
matrices coming from Groebner basis computations.



=== DEBUGGING ===
In order to debug gb one needs to use
libtool e gdb --args ./gb --options
since we build the library using libtool and link it than against the binary gb.
